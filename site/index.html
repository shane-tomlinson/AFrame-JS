			<h2>Not Another DOM Manipulation Library!</h2>

			<p>
				AFrame is an <strong>application development framework</strong>, not another DOM manipulation library!  AFrame provides functionality
				found in more traditional frameworks like .NET or the Java JDK- items like models, views, observables, plugins, schemas, data containers,
				data collections, forms, and fields.  These items provide a way of developing event driven MVC applications where complexity is managed
				through clean code, and where generic, reusable components enable more work to be done with less code.
			</p>

			<p>
				AFrame is being developed out of the frustration of not having a proper application framework at my disposal when I first
				started using Javascript to write web applications.  There are plenty of DOM manipulation libraries (jQuery, Prototype, Dojo, YUI),
				but these do not provide the functionality necessary to write MVC applications.  There are some frameworks that provide hundreds of 
				widgets (Dojo, YUI, Sencha Labs), but these are so heavyweight that they can be confusing and cumbersome. There are still others 
				that completely shield you from writing Javascript (Cappachino) but what is the point, I want to write my Javascript in Javascript, not Objective-C.
				All these frameworks have the added drawback of being hundreds of kilobytes.  The web is about Javascript, and developers have
				for too long been building unmaintainable web sites using procedural methodologies that went out of style 15 years ago.
			</p>
			
			<p>	There is a need for a light weight Object Oriented <strong>application</strong> framework which provides a clean way to write
				full fledged applications in a traditional MVC style.  It is time for web-app development to mature and use ideas that other languages
				have been using for years.  Backbone and Knockout-JS are two similar libraries that address this need, and now AFrame does too.
			</p>

			<p>
				AFrame right now depends on jQuery, this is used to work with displays.  I am hoping to remove this
				dependency to keep things as flexible as possible.  All of the data related items work without jQuery.
			</p>

			<p>
			To use AFrame without compilation, you can grab the current version from <a href="https://github.com/stomlinson/AFrame-JS">GitHub</a> in dist/aframe-current.js or dist/aframe-current.min.js
			</p>

			<p>
				Unit tests use the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/test/">YUI 3: Test</a> library.  These can be run by browsing to the tests directory and opening index.html

			<h2>To download and build the libraries and docs</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Apache Ant is required.  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Go get it.</a>  Ant allows for concurrent development in both Unix/Linux and Windows flavored OSes.</li>
				<li>Download the source from <a href="https://github.com/stomlinson/AFrame-JS/zipball/master">GitHub</a> or pull a copy using <a href="https://github.com/stomlinson/AFrame-JS">Git</a></li>
				<li>The sample per_user.properties.sample must be personalized and copied to per_user.properties</li>
				<li>run "ant all" to do a full build.</li>
