			<h2>Not Another DOM Manipulation Library!</h2>

			<p>
				AFrame is an <strong>application development library</strong>, not another DOM manipulation library!  AFrame is a library aimed squarely at
                filling a huge need in the Javascript world, one that allows traditional <strong>applications</strong> to be built.  This is not like jQuery,
                MooTools, or YUI that give you DOM manipulation capabilities, AFrameJS gives you the ability to create MVC applications.
                AFrameJS's power lies in its ability to keep data separated from presentation.  The concept of separating models, views, and controllers has
                been mainstream for years, but something that has seen very slow uptake among web developers.   So much code that is produced for 
                the web has these concepts entangled, with the result being difficult to maintain spaghetti.
             </p>

             <p>
                It is time for web-app development to mature and use ideas that other languages have been using for years.  AFrame is being developed to address the need of having a true MVC framework to develop real applications with.  <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone</a> and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout-JS</a> are two similar libraries that address this need, now AFrame does too.
             </p>

             <p>
                Since AFrameJS is built using Javascript, it takes advantage of several of Javascript's most powerful features, most notably the ability to mix
                Object Oriented, Functional, and Aspect Oriented styles.  By using a combination of these features, AFrameJS provides clean mechanisms to 
                model data, and create views that display and react to changes to that data.  It provides HTML5 compatible form validation, model validation,
                it helps manage lists of data, as well as very versatile collection classes.
             </p>
		  
	 		<p>
				AFrame is DOM library agnostic, meaning it can be used with any DOM library.  All library level DOM manipulation
                is done using DOM adapters, currently there are adapters for jQuery, MooTools and Prototype.                
	 		</p>

			<p>
                To use AFrame without compilation, you can grab the current version from <a href="https://github.com/stomlinson/AFrame-JS">GitHub</a> 
                in dist/aframe-current-XXX.js or dist/aframe-current-XXX.min.js where XXX is the DOM adapter of your choice.

        <section class="grid_12">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <p>
                AFrame provides base level components necessary to start creating full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a>(MVC) style applications.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Models</h3>
            <p>
                In AFrame, a <a href="docs/AFrame.Model.html">Model</a> is made up of a <a href="docs/AFrame.DataContainer.html">DataContainer</a> and a <a href="docs/AFrame.Schema.html">Schema.</a> A <a href="docs/AFrame.DataContainer.html">DataContainer</a> 
                is the object that holds data.  A <a href="docs/AFrame.Schema.html">Schema</a> acts as both a template and a filter when working with data objects.
                Models combine the power of both of these, but each can be used individually.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Models are often times part of a larger collection, in Javascript they are often part of either hashes or arrays.  
                This is why AFrame provides two data collections, <a href="docs/AFrame.CollectionHash.html">CollectionHash</a> and <a href="docs/AFrame.CollectionArray.html">CollectionArray</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Views</h3>
            <p>
                MVC Views are called a <a href="docs/AFrame.Display.html">Displays</a>.  There are several types of Displays, but the basic 
                Display provides very basic DOM and DOM event functionality.  A <a href="docs/AFrame.Field.html">Field</a> 
                provides two pieces of functionality, input and output.  When used as input, a Field can get input from the user, 
                validate the data, clean up the data, and display helpful hints when there are problems.  A <a href="docs/AFrame.Form.html">Form</a> 
                is a composite of <a href="docs/AFrame.Field.html">Fields</a>.  A <a href="docs/AFrame.DataForm.html">DataForm</a> takes 
                this one step further and binds a form to a <a href="docs/AFrame.DataContainer.html">DataContainer</a> allowing 
                changes in input to automatically update its corresponding model when all fields are valid.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just as models are parts of a larger collection, often times Displays need to be part of a larger <a href="docs/AFrame.List.html">List</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Controllers</h3>
            <p>
                There has to be some fun in programming.  You get to write whatever controllers you want.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How is this AOP?</h3>
            <p>
                Since AFrame tries to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect Oriented</a> as much as 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented_programming">Object Oriented</a>, it provides strong <a href="docs/AFrame.Observable.html">Observable</a>(events) 
                and <a href="docs/AFrame.Plugin.html">Plugin</a> systems.  Observables make it easy to listen for specific events that happen on an object, anybody 
                who has worked with DOM Events already has an intrinsic understanding of how Observables work.
                Plugins are a way of extending the functionality of an object through composition instead of directly subclassing that object.  
                This means a small piece of functionality can be written once and may be shared across several seemingly unrelated classes.  
                It also means that configuring an object is incredibly flexible.  When writing an object, you no longer need to write one gigantic class
                that does everything.  With plugins, you can write a small base class and put all the peripheral functionality into
                plugins, when the time comes to create an object, only create an object with the bits of functionality that are needed.  
                Developing this way makes testing and debugging much easier and faster.  It also means if a piece of functionality is no longer needed, 
                you can bin just the bit you don't want and not mess with the rest.

            <h2>The underlying principles of development in AFrame are:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Create the basic classes necessary to create an MVC application</li>
                <li>A powerful event system makes life much simpler and more flexible than chains of callbacks</li>
                <li>Favor composition over inheritance, use AOP to augment OOP whenever it makes sense</li>
                <li>Forms are central to nearly all web applications</li>
                <li>Collections of related data are essential</li>
                <li>Use features/standards from HTML5 where possible</li>
                <li>Be database agnostic - who knows what data persistence schemes are going to be used</li>
                <li>Clean up references when objects are torn down so that memory leaks are minimized</li>
                <li>Make AFrame as easy to add on to as possible</li>
            </ul>
